Private Urls
============

This is a simple daemon that will look for very short urls and direct
you to where you want to go. You can define these small redirections
through a minimal configuration file.

Examples
--------

# Static redirections
m/ -> mail.google.com/
m2/ -> mail.google.com/u/2/
docs/ -> docs.google.com/

# more complex redirections using capturing groups
s/1/1293 -> sprint.ly/products/1/ticket/1293


How it works
------------

DNS Server:
1. Request comes into the DNS server
2. if requested_url is in config_file:
3.   respond (localhost, _)
   else
4.   respond (_, no clue. ask another dns server)


Web Server:
1. Request comes into web server
2. if requested_url is in config_file
3.   respond (302<url>, _)
